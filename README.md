# RPN Calculator
An implementation of an RPN calculator.

## Dependencies
Java 8 and Gradle are required to build and run the calculator.

## Test
```
$ gradle test
```

## Run
The calculator can be run via gradle but the user experience is not great:

```
$ gradle run
```

It is better to run it from the command line or in an IDE:

```
$ gradle jar
$ java -jar build/libs/rpn-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To exit use Ctrl-C.

## Docs
There is a class diagram in the doc folder.
