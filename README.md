# RNP Calculator
An implementation of an RNP calculator.

## Dependencies
Java 8 is required to build and run the calculator.

## Test
`$ gradlew test`

## Run
The calculator can be run via gradle but the user experience is not great:

`$ gradlew run`

It is better to run it from the command line or in an IDE:

```
$ gradlew jar
$ java -jar build/libs/rnp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To exit either use Ctrl-C.

## Docs
There is a class diagram in the doc folder.
